            From the ashes to the sun, these words can frankly describe the rapid growth of the Soviet state in-between the 20s and 30s of the XX century. But can it though? The Soviet Union, or the USSR, was constructed upon the crippling backbone of a nation depleted by the First World War, which then swiftly poured into the First Russian civil war; there was only a little chance this period of history could have produced a country, which would not have turned into a dictatorship with only one, let’s be honest quite handsome Georgian, seizing power in his iron fists.

            It might seem not so obvious now, but the red country, upon its creation, was thought of to become the land of free (workers) and the foothold of the World Revolution. Yet, all the dreams and efforts of the communists came to an end, when from the very beginning their expectations were infamously crushed. On the first All-Russian Constituent Assembly elections in 1918 —Bolsheviks had hopelessly lost, with less than a quarter of the population expressing their support for Lenin’s believes in their votes. A day after the results were declared, Lenin dissolved the parliament as well as declared all of the other parties counter-revolutionary, opening a “hunt season” for his fellow Bolsheviks. There is no legitimate information regarding Lenin’s attitude towards the repressions, he, however, was the one who unravelled the death-wheel of terror in the country.

            After his death, the <a href="https://www.britannica.com/place/Soviet-Union/The-U-S-S-R-from-the-death-of-Lenin-to-the-death-of-Stalin" class="a"> inner struggle</a> inner struggle had begun in the communist party. Despite this, for an outside spectator, the situation seemed to be getting better, behind the curtain the stage looked like a bullet-chess game, pieces were being moved all over the board, eventually one seemingly unnoticeable pawn promoting to a Queen; the pawn was Joseph Jughashvili (Stalin). Joseph, a man with some rather unusual background. The son of a <a href="http://www.hrono.ru/biograf/bio_d/dzhuga_beso.php" class="a">shoemaker</a>  in Tbilisi, capital of today’s Georgia, who attended a spiritual seminary, while being agnostic. Looking back at his life prior to the revolution and the way he was fundraising the communist business, raiding banks and wealthy individuals all over the empire. These early years of his must have defined Stalin’s personality, a lack of trust and constant fear of treason threat from anyone around him. The infamous photoshop of the 1920s explicitly shows how cruel was his regime.

            Divide and conquer. The quote, believed to be first said by Julius Cesar a Roman general and emperor, suits Stalin’s way of ruling. He constructed such an environment where you never know how is your friend and how is an enemy. The game with zero-sum, where in order to gain you would have to take it away from someone. Denunciation letters became a huge part of life under Stalin’s regime. According to article 58 clauses 2 and 12 of the criminal codex of the USSR dated 1926, anyone who is aware of a forthcoming threat for the regime and will not disclose it will be prosecuted by six-month incarceration (10 years for military personnel), however, under the article 58 this conditions were rarely applied. In the absolute majority of times, clause 1(a) was used, which stated: treason: execution by firing squad or 10-year incarceration, both with expropriation. Here comes the biggest difference between life before and after the revolution. According to the <a href="https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/reglamentatsiya-konfiskatsii-imuschestva-v-ugolovnom-zakonodatelstve-rossii-ulozhenie-o-nakazaniyah-ugolovnyh-i-ispravitelnyh-1845-g-i/viewer" class="a">1903</a>  criminal code expropriation was almost completely terminated and could only be used to seize the means of crime or its results. Moreover, in the 1920s and 1930s USSR there was no free trial, if a citizen was wrongly accused of treason, with absolute certainty they would have been executed regardless of the proofs. Up until Stalin’s death denunciation was a way to rocket a career or gain political or monetary leverage from a concurrent or even a neighbour. Although it’s impossible to identify the real amount of denunciations written, according to <a class="a" href="https://secretmag.ru/stories/osobo-bditelnye-tovarishi.htm">Secretmag</a>, during the 1930s alone, people wrote more than 4 million letters to the NKVD (People's Commissariat for Internal Affairs).

                <div class="text-main"> An example of a denunciation letter:  <br> <br> STATEMENT <br><br>
                    In the Bureau of the Komsomol Institute. <br>
                    I ask you to analyze the case of the former Komsomol member MAGAI as <br>
                    On May 22 of this year, before the class of Professor Azerier, during a break, he told me some jokes, there were 3 of them that are clearly anti-Soviet in nature: <br>
                    (three untranslatable joke where he deciphers the USSR in a humourable way) <br><br>
                    1) USSR - he deciphered as - Soviet herring stands
                    ruble. <br>
                    2) USSR - Soviet sugar costs a ruble. <br>
                    3) RSFSR - Guys, see Fedka dismissed the snot. <br><br>
                    In addition, he wrote a number of letters and began to decipher in his own way, talking about some kind of money, etc. <br>
                    All this can be confirmed without a seal by student Ivanyuk. And in general, I think the case of Magai is blurred, it has not received a sufficient signal to everything that he is starting to become more active again. <br><br>
                    13/6 1937. <br><br>
                    Student of the 71st group of the IV course. member of the Komsomol.</div>
                <div class="sub-text">
                    As a resul of this letter Magai David Semenovich was arrested on aug. 20th 1937, later sent to a labour camp in Ukhtizhemlag.

            There were various types of them. The most common ones were Professional and personal. Usually, professional letters included those written to get rid of the opponent or take down someone out of envy in the workplace. Personal, on the other hand, could have been the outcomes of the discords or again human envy. One particular example, also from Secretmag, colourfully explains how it all worked back then. In September 1936 Boris Tal, the head of the printing and publishing department at the CC AUCP(b)[Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party of Bolsheviks] addressed еo party secretariat, including Stalin. In his letter, Tan demanded the dismissal of his colleague, Lev Sosnovsky, a member of the editing board of the Izvestia (from Rus.: “tidings”) newspaper. After a month and a half, the letter reached its addressee; Sosnovsky was arrested, and later in 1937 executed. Boris gained what he wanted as well as receiving a promotion as a reward for serving his state, becoming a managing editor of the newspaper. Yet,  later same fate found him. In December 1937 he was arrested and executed 10 months after.

            Even though denunciations were only a tiny part of the murderous conveyor that was the USSR in its first 30 years the formed structure tells us not only the inhuman nature of the ruthless dictatorship that the Soviets had constructed but also the real Stalin’s character, a cruel mastermind with an enormous ego and fear of being stubbed in the back. He was that little shark that ate all his siblings in order to survive, erecting the regime in its own image and likeliness, where even the time of Nikolay II, the most terrible Russian tsar, would look like a temple of freedom in comparison to the mighty Soviets.
